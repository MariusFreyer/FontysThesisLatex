# FontysThesisTemplate

This is a LaTeX template according to the regulations for internship and bachelor thesis reports 
at Fontys Hogeschool Techniek and Logistiek in Venlo. It includes the havard citation style by using BibTeX. 

## Getting started with the template

The template was only tested on macOS 10.12+ and MacTex as Latex Distribution. However it should also work with other
operating systems and Latex Distributions.

    1. Install [link](http://www.tug.org/mactex/ "MacTex) (for homebrew users: brew install mactex)
    2. Install [link](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/ TexMaker) (homebrew: brew cask install texmaker)
    3. Open TexMaker preferences and change *Quick Build* options to *PdfLaTeX + Bib(la)tex + PdfLaTeX (x2) + View Pdf*
    4. Also in the *Quick Build* tab change the command of *Bib(la)tex to `"biber" %`
